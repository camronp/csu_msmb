segmentation	partitioning an image to assign a label to every pixel or group of pixels with similar characteristics
slots	a part, element, or "property" of an R object
classification	an ordered set of related categories used to group data by its similarities
feature extraction	reducing the number of resources required to describe a large data set with the intention of being informative and non-redundant
spatial point process	a random collection of coordinates or points randomly located along an underlying mathematical space
Poisson Process	a model for events that occur with a frequency in time
Ripley's K function	a descriptive statistic for detecting the deviations from spatial homogeneity and can help determine if points are random, dispersed, or clustered
pair correlation function	a description of how the point density varies as a function of distance from the point of reference
spatial transformation	changes to a coordinate system that provides a new approach to defining variation of material parameters
linear filter	refining an image such that the output pixel is a combination of the time-varying input pixels subject to the constraint of linearity
dynamic range	the ratio or logarithmic value of the difference between the largest and smallest values
noise reduction	the process of removing the undesirable variation in image pixelation 
adaptive thresholding	segmenting an image using smaller regions that are defined by the range of local intensity values
binary images	an image consisting of pixels that can only have one of exactly two values, usually black and white
morphological operations	the relative ordering of pixel values based on the shape of image features
Voronoi tessellation	partitioning an image plane into regions closest to each set of points. Line segments are formed equidistant to the two nearest points
convex hull	the smallest polygon that encloses all of the points of interest in a set
spatial dependence	the propensity for nearby points to influence each other and possess similar attributes
virion	infectious nucleic acid surrounded by a protective protein capsid
actin	globular proteins that form the microfilaments essential for cell mobility and division
macrophages	immune cells responsible for engulfing potential pathogens and other lymphatic particles
dendritic cells	immune cells responsible for processing foreign material and presenting it to other cells in the immune system
light sheet microscopy	a method that illuminates a specimen in a single plane and detected from the perpendicular direction
